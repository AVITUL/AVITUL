Standard gas sensor data-set from UCI ML repository was cleaned and attacked to produce the desired attack pattern. The sensor readings were then categorized to reflect the attack. Multiple machine learning models were trained and a comparison of the results was made.

A Fog infrastructure is proposed to share the machine model parameters to maintain sync so as to counter any zero day attacks.
