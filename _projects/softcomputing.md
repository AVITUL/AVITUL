This course-work related project covers implementation of different Optimization techniques like Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. Also included are optimizing TSP, HEFT Processor Scheduling and a set of points on 2D plane. Invasive weed optimization is demonstrated in a crude form.

Implemented Jaya Algorithm, a modern approach in Optimization.

Associated with National Institute of Technology Kurukshetra.
