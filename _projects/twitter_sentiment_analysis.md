The project is aimed to analyze user sentiments on twitter and comparing them to news from popular sources. Thereby identifying any false trends.

18000 tweets were collected over a span of 6 hours to form the base dataset. The dataset is then cleaned to extract useful tweets. Top 5 trends were then identified and analysed for sentiments. I have used python libraries 'tweepy', 'pandas', 'pymongo', 'textblob' in the process.

Textblob was used to clean up the text further and to analyze the sentiments with NLP functionality.

Sentiments are then plotted geographically to visualize regional factors affecting the users' views.
