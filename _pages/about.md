Building LLM powered enterprise applications at scale. Focus on service reliability and observability. Bringing LLMs in-house.

Previously: Applied Research at Proshort. Built multiple LLM powered products in enterprise sales. Video to shorts, meeting analysis, articulation assistant, LLMOps; powered by Agentic frameworks, custom RAGs. I am a huge fan of Rajinikanth.
